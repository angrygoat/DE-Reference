------------------------------------------------------------

This (work-in-progress) project sits beside the CyVerse DE code and Ansible/Docker 
scripts and provides additional support in terms of prerequisites and setup
outside the scope of the core DE installation.

By default, this script, run along with the DE installs, creates a reference 
implementation that can be used as a basis for integration and functional testing and 
software issue replication.

This is something of a stand-in at the moment, as the current reference 
implementation code is actually mixed in with the AngryGoat DE installs.  This
will be refactored over time.
