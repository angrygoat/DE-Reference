## Welcome to the AngryGoat Discovery Environment wiki!

Please find in these pages documentation to assist newcomers in standing up their own instance of the Cyverse Discovery Environment. Note that [Cyverse's repository](https://github.com/cyverse/DE/tree/master/ansible) includes master playbooks for Discovery Environment-specific services and configuration, while the forthcoming Community Edition aims to provide additional/optional playbooks for related services (Condor, iRODS, etc.) to allow installation from scratch. In the mean time, please feel free to use this repository as a reference implementation.

Each service's README.md includes a short description of its purpose and function; a newcomer will want to look over the [annotated example group_vars](https://github.com/angrygoat/DE/blob/master/ansible/docs/AnnotatedGroupVars) file which contains nearly all Discovery Environment configuration.
